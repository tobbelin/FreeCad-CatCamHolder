# FreeCad-CatCamHolder
## Introduction
Welcome to the Camera Holder for Cat project! 
This repository contains the project files for my very simple cam holder for a cheap china camera. Goes under many names.

The holder is designed to be 3d printed and i just created it with minimal effort and without being any good at using FreeCad, so please take it as it is and improve it.
I designed it to be easily attached to our cats normal collar.

All i wanted was for the camera to be better angled, the holder that came with the camera gave us long videos of grass seen from above.
